# Virtual-Mouse
Now a days the technology is becoming more powerful and efficient so 
the importance of the human interaction is rapidly increasing. The interaction between human 
and computer is evolving since the invention of computer technology becomes flexible. Most 
devices use touch pads and screen technology which cannot be affordable to all the applications. 
The mouse is one of the excellent inventions in HCI (HumanComputer Interaction) technology. 
Through wireless or Bluetooth mouse technology is invented still, that technology is not 
completely device free. A Bluetooth mouse has the requirement of battery power and connecting 
dongle. Presence of extra devices in a mouse increases the difficulty to use it. The proposed 
mouse system is beyond this limitation. This project proposes a virtual mouse based on HCI 
using computer vision and hand gestures. Gestures captured with a camera or webcam and 
processed with colour segmentation & detection technique. The user will be allowed to control 
some of the computer cursor functions with their hands. Primarily, a user can perform left clicks, 
right clicks, and double clicks, scrolling up or down using their hands in different gestures. This 
system captures frames using a webcam and processes the frames to make them track-able and 
after that recognizes different gestures made by users and perform the mouse function. So, the 
proposed system eliminates device dependency in order to use a mouse. Therefore, it can be 
proved beneficial in order to develop HCI technology.
